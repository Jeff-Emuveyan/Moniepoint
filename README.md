# Moniepoint Translation Test

*Ensure you have the latest version of Android studio (Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1 preferrably) before cloning this repository.*

This is a parcel track delivery android app gotten from this design: https://dribbble.com/shots/21617837-Movemate-Shipments-Mobile-App

Animations in the design have been implemented.

The application is designed entirely in [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

## Dependencies

1) Jetpack Compose
2) Hilt
3) Navigation Compose

## Module Structure

I followed the **Google recommended** [modularization structure](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization/patterns#types-of-modules),
and I grouped the code base into three main modules: 
1) ```app```: This is the container module of the application. Its sole duty is to display all features of the application
2) ```core```: The core module serves as the base module. It contains code that can be resued across any part of the code base.
3) ```feature```: The feature module contains all features of the application.

## Something extra! üòÅüòÅ

I added an automated UI test using [UiAutomator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/other-components/ui-automator) to launch and verify that the
the expected Composables are visbile when the app is launched.
This automated test can be found here:
